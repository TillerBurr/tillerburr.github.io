# The Beginning

This is the first post of my blog. I decided to finally write a blog. I've been
thinking about writing a blog for a while now. I finally started for a couple of
reasons:

* Have a place to write down my thoughts.
* Help with learning a new programming language (Currently Go)
* Help build my muscle memory while switching to a new keyboard layout (A customized Dvorak layout,
based on [ThePrimeagen's Keyboards](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards))

## About Me

I live in Wisconsin. I have a wonderful wife and 4 kids (8 and under). I love learning,
solving problems and just having my mind challenged. My current position is Data Science
Engineer. I do about 50% Data Science ane 50% Software Engineering.

I have a PhD in Math with a Statistics Concentration. Statistics is a really cool field
that takes a small subset of a population and find useful information about the
larger population. The main reason I chose Statistics was because of the unknowns inherently involved. How can you
know something unknowable? Seems like a hard problem. Sign me up. Getting a PhD in that hard field is hard.
Great, I'm there. Why am I not doing something more in line with my degree? I fell in love with programming.

I was always a nerdy kid that was more into technology than sports. I had tinkered with programming, but never
really got into it. Fast forward to college. I used a lot of languages during my coursework: SAS, SPSS, Matlab,
R, Mathematica, etc. I was never formally introduced to Python. It wasn't until a relative asked me to create a
program that could process a file and generate an output. The languages I was used to weren't really meant to do that
(at least I couldn't find any examples.) I needed to find something that would work and relatively easy to learn.
Enter Python. I had heard it being mentioned in passing, but as I did my research, it became the clear choice. No pointers
or references (that I had to deal with.) All that remained was being able to give the finished program to my
relative. Thanks to PyInstaller, I was able to, albeit with some difficulty, create an executable that I could send off.
PyInstaller only ran on legacy Python back then, so I started my Python journey with Python 2.7. I haven't looked back.
I was relatively close to finishing my doctorate and didn't want to abandon that effort, but I knew I was going to
program.

### Highly Abridged Work History

I'll mention a little bit about work and the experiences I've had, but won't go into detail. That's for another post.
I've been programming in Python for 10 years, 7 in my professional life. I automated as much of my workload as I could.
That allowed me to be able to write more applications for other parts of the company. My boss mentioned an idea for an
app that would be useful to clients, but one of the developers wouldn't be able to do it. After a month, I had a proof of
concept, a Flask app with a PostgreSQL database deployed on Digital Ocean. I had to learn JavaScript, but that made the
experience even better. A few months later, I had switched the UI to React and had a few more iterations under my belt. Right
before it was going to be sold, I was informed that it needed two-factor authentication. The package I was using
didn't support that. Luckily, there was a maintained fork: Flask-Security-Too. The maintainer was very willing to
accept my pull request. After some back and forth, the feature was merged.

In addition to the above app (it was a way to select customers for marketing mini-campaigns), I also have developed applications
that helped book hotel rooms for customers that were given discounts, clean and process data, download and collate data from an internal
web site, and much more. Along the way, I decided that I wanted to learn a compiled language. I had been hearing good
things about Rust and decided to try it out. The ownership model, while a bit awkward at first, is quite nice. I wrote a
few apps in Rust and have loved every minute of it. Due to my need to always learn, I'm currently learning Go.

## Computer Stuff

For work, I use a Windows machine, but do 95% of my work in WSL. At home, I use mainly Ubuntu, but have recently installed Pop!_OS.
So far, so good.

I use Neovim, btw. I started using it a few years ago, after VS Code became way too bloated. I always wondered why people
used Vim/Neovim, but I know differently now.

I mentioned at the beginning that I am switching to a new keyboard layout. After many years of QWERTY, my hands were
starting to hurt and needed to switch. It's different and I find myself typing the old way often, but that should get better
with time. The hardest thing though are the symbols. This way makes more sense to me, so I am sticking with it.

## Hobbies

Sick of reading about me yet? Me neither. Just kidding, I'm almost done. Almost all of the entries will be shorter.
This is just a list of hobbies I have, in no particular order.

* Woodworking
* Growing hot peppers/Gardening
* Cooking
* Making hot sauce
* Spending time with my family
* Reading
* Learning new things (did you catch that I like to learn?)


## The End
Thanks for reading!
